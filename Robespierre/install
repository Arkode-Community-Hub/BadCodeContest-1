I assume you have nasm, ld and are on an AMD64 PC. If you don't have any of those, idk bro, invest in a computer or smth.
First take main.asm, then open a shell.
You can then do, on the folder you have main.asm in:
$ nasm -felf64 main.asm -o bf.o
$ ld bf.o -o bf
Congrats, you have compiled a program!
Now, let's open our bad interpreter.
$ ./bf
+==============================================================================+
|/			     Welcome to x85 BF interpreter!			   \|
|#		     Please type some BF code, then type R then ENTER		   #|

|#			  64KB of tape free and 64KB of program free		   #|

+==============================================================================+

You can now type your BF program. Once you're done, type 'R' then enter. Your program will then execute.
NOTE: Any input not taken by the interpreter will be passed to the shell! Also it acts quirky af.
