# BadCodeContest #1

Welcome to the BCC nÂ°1 ! After waiting so long, you can finally submit your "great" code.

## Rules

- The app should interpret the [brainfuck](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) file `./sample.bf` when executed
  - OR do something else related to the theme, which will be described in detail in `<user>/task.md`
- There should be clear instructions on how to run the program
- The source code should be accessible and documented in the submitted folder
- The application must be compilable with a common utility program (ex: `node`, `cargo`)
  - OR there should be a `.nix` file that includes all dependencies

## Submitting

Please open a pull request that adds a folder with your name (Discord nick/user) and nothing else.
