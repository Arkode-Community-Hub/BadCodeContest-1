# BadCodeContest #1

Welcome to the BCC nÂ°1 ! After waiting so long, you can finally submit your "great" code.

## Rules

- The app should print [fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) entries from 0 to 100 when executed
- There should be clear instructions on how to run the program
- The source code should be accessible and documented in the submitted folder
- The application must be compilable with a common utility program (ex: `node`, `cargo`)
  - OR there should be a `.nix` file that includes all dependencies

## Submitting

Please open a pull request that adds a folder with your name (Discord nick/user) and nothing else.
